Navigate to different branches for different DILATE implementation on different datasets (synthetic dataset, wafer and traffic dataset).

## Initialise Conda or Virtual Environment

### For Conda
```
conda create -n environment_name --file req.txt
```

### For venv
```
pip install venv
python3 -m venv environment_name
pip install -r req.txt
```
If it does not work then rename req.txt to requirements.txt
